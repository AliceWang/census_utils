To use this program, you need shapefiles with population data.
If your shapefiles do not have population data (as in the USA)
you want a program like census_merge, which is available here:
http://github.com/JoshJGT/census_merge

(Note that census_merge only works on USA-style census popfile/shapefile data.
If your data is in another format, you will need to modify the merger program.)
