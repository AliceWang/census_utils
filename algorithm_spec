INPUT
  a state divided in meshblocks. Each meshblock contains population data and type data (water, parkland, commercial, residential,...)

OUTPUT
  a set of meshblock groupings that represent districts.

DISTRICTING CRITERIA
(see http://aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/Overview.htm):

  * standard deviation for the average population per district in each disctrict must not be greater than +/-10%;
  * physical features and area of the proposed division; and
  * existing boundaries of divisions in the State or Territory.

VALIDATION
  * we can check if the average standard deviation of the population per district obtained with our algorithm is lower than the one in the current districting (>16% in some districts)
  * we can check if there are districts whose boundaries disregard natural borders

ALGORITHM

-1. Eliminate zero-blocks (blocks with area=0) DONE
0. Calculate ideal population of each district DONE
1. Find islands (separated clusters of meshblocks) and mainland (the biggest of such clusters) DONE
2. Find natural borders (find "water we know about") DONE
3. For each island, calculate how much (%) of the ideal population that island contains
4. Link the islands:
	- take an island I
	- find the closest island or meshblock in mainland
	- if a mainland meshblock is found, link and stop
	- otherwise, link the island and repeat
	- IMPORTANT: LINK ONLY IF THE POPULATION IS LESS THAN 100% THE IDEAL POP. AND WILL NOT EXCEED 105%
5. Calculate districts (heuristics go here):
	- take the most populated block
	- N=1
	- if adding N neighbors makes the district "complete" (=100% ideal population +/-10%), add that neighbor and start with the next district
	- repeat with N+1 until all neighbors have been used and the district is not complete.
	- if all the neighbors have been added, start with the next set of neighbors
6. Assign the unassigned (??)
